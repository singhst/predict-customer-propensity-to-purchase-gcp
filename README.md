Tutorial [link](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/predicting-customer-propensity-to-buy).

We will get ecommerce datasets of Google Merchandise Store, process the data to become training data (features + labels), to train and evaluate ML models and deploy ML models to AI Platform

# The Dataset
